a) In the interactive session, we saw reaction fluxes in a linear pathway being equal to each other due to mass balance constraints. Do you observe the same thing now for the maximal reaction activities? Explain your observations. 

No, the maximal reaction activities are not equal in linear pathways. They vary a lot, because they reflect estimated enzyme capacity from gene expression, not steady-state flux balance. 

b) Some reactions have no maximal reaction activity data. Identify at least two different kinds of such reactions, and explain why gene expression-derived data would not be applicable for these kinds of reactions.

Exchange/transport reactions like EX_pyr_e, EX_for_e, EX_acald_e. These aren’t catalyzed by intracellular enzymes → no gene expression to map. Additionally, Non-enzymatic/pseudoreactions like FORti, these aren’t linked to specific genes, so expression data isn’t meaningful.
